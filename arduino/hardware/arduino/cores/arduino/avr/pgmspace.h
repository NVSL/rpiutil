    \endcode

    The functions in this module provide interfaces for a program to access
    data stored in program space (flash memory) of the device.  In order to
    use these functions, the target device must support either the \c LPM or
    \c ELPM instructions.

    \note These functions are an attempt to provide some compatibility with
    header files that come with IAR C, to make porting applications between
    different compilers easier.  This is not 100% compatibility though (GCC
    does not have full support for multiple address spaces yet).

    \note If you are working with strings which are completely based in ram,
    use the standard string functions described in \ref avr_string.

    \note If possible, put your constant tables in the lower 64 KB and use
    pgm_read_byte_near() or pgm_read_word_near() instead of
    pgm_read_byte_far() or pgm_read_word_far() since it is more efficient that
    way, and you can still use the upper 64K for executable code.
    All functions that are suffixed with a \c _P \e require their
    arguments to be in the lower 64 KB of the flash ROM, as they do
    not use ELPM instructions.  This is normally not a big concern as
    the linker setup arranges any program space constants declared
    using the macros from this header file so they are placed right after
    the interrupt vectors, and in front of any executable code.  However,
    it can become a problem if there are too many of these constants, or
    for bootloaders on devices with more than 64 KB of ROM.
    <em>All these functions will not work in that situation.</em>
